Run on an HPC, the TumorModel.py program performs parameter inference for the TumorModel (that is also found on https://pyabc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/multiscale_agent_based.html ) twice, once in look-ahead mode and once in standard mode. It saves the databases and already creates some images visualizing the posterior distribution.
The .ipynb file loads the databases and then performs additional visualizations of credible intervals and also compares the runtimes/how the epsilon values develop over time.
