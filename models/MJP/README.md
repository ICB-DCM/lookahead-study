The .ipynb file defines the model based on the Gillespie algorithm and runs it with the different scheduling versions. It also generates some small visualizations of the results. This was mainly run locally. 
MJPRuntime.py takes the same model, runs it multiple times for different population sizes and only saves the results. This was created to be run on an HPC after adapting the paths.
