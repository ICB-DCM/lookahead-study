For now this repository mainly consists of the Testresults of the different tests (ODE/Markov Jump Process/Tumor)
and the jupyter/python code i have used to generate the data and the corresponding images.

Also the Batch_pyABC fodler includes the version of Emads shell scripts i used to run the programs on the Jewels cluster.
